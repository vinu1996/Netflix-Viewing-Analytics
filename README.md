Title: Uncovering My Viewing Habits: A Data-Driven Exploration of My Netflix History
Situation
As a data enthusiast, I decided to dive deep into my own Netflix viewing history to better understand my preferences and viewing patterns. This analysis was not only a fun personal project but also an opportunity to apply data analytics techniques to gain meaningful insights.
Task
The goal was to analyze various aspects of my Netflix viewing data, such as the distribution of movies and TV shows, monthly viewing trends, content preferences by country, favorite genres, age certification of content, and yearly content distribution. These insights would help me better understand my viewing habits and make informed recommendations for a more personalized viewing experience.
Action
To achieve this, I structured my analysis around the following key sections from my dashboard:
1. Movies and TV Shows Distribution
•	Insight: My interactive pie chart revealed that I watched 70% TV shows and 30% movies. I seem to enjoy getting immersed in long story arcs that TV shows provide.
•	Recommendation: I should explore more critically acclaimed TV series that align with my favorite genres to maintain my interest and keep binge-watching exciting.
2. Contents Watched per Month
•	Insight: I noticed a spike in my viewing during the winter months, particularly in December, likely due to the holidays and more free time indoors.
•	Recommendation: I can plan to catch up on new releases and explore new series during these peak viewing times. Creating a watchlist in advance could make my viewing experience more organized and enjoyable.
3. Total Movies and TV Shows by Countries
•	Insight: Most of the content I watched originated from the United States, with significant portions from the United Kingdom and Canada.
•	Recommendation: I should broaden my horizons by exploring content from other countries, such as South Korea or Spain, to discover diverse storytelling styles and cultural perspectives.
4. Contents by Countries
•	Insight: Content from the US and UK dominated my viewing history, reflecting my preference for English-language content.
•	Recommendation: To diversify my viewing experience, I could explore more foreign-language films and series, perhaps starting with popular international hits that have received critical acclaim.
5. Top Genres
•	Insight: Thriller and sci-fi emerged as my top genres, accounting for 55% and 30% of my total viewing time, respectively.
•	Recommendation: Given my strong preference for these genres, I should keep an eye out for new releases in the thriller and sci-fi categories. Joining online communities or following genre-specific forums could help me stay updated on must-watch titles.
6. Age Certification of Contents
•	Insight: A significant portion of my watched content was rated for mature audiences (18+), with fewer titles suitable for younger viewers.
•	Recommendation: While I enjoy mature content, I could balance my viewing by including more family-friendly titles, which could be great for watching with friends or family members.
7. Content Distribution by Years
•	Insight: I showed a preference for newer content, with most of the titles I watched being released within the last five years.
•	Recommendation: To keep my viewing experience fresh and exciting, I should continue exploring recent releases. Additionally, revisiting some classic or highly-rated older films and series might offer a nostalgic or enriching experience.
Result
The analysis of my Netflix viewing history provided several valuable insights into my preferences and habits. By understanding these patterns, I can make more informed decisions about what to watch next, ensuring a more enjoyable and personalized viewing experience.
Conclusion
This personal project underscored the power of data analytics in uncovering meaningful insights from everyday activities. By analyzing my own viewing data, I not only gained a deeper understanding of my preferences but also honed my skills in data analysis and visualization. This exercise demonstrated my ability to turn raw data into actionable recommendations, a crucial skill in today's data-driven world.
